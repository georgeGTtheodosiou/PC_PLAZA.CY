            <h2>PC Parts Overview</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit):</strong> The brain of your PC that handles all processing tasks. Examples include Intel Core and AMD Ryzen.</li>
                <li><strong>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):</strong> Responsible for rendering images, videos, and games. Examples include NVIDIA GeForce and AMD Radeon.</li>
                <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> The main circuit board that connects all components together, allowing them to communicate. Examples include ASUS ROG and MSI MPG.</li>
                <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong> Temporary memory used by the CPU to store and access data quickly. Examples include Corsair Vengeance and G.SKILL TridentZ.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage (HDD/SSD):</strong> Where all your data and programs are stored. SSDs are faster, while HDDs offer more storage at a lower cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Supply Unit (PSU):</strong> Converts power from the outlet to usable power for your components. Examples include EVGA SuperNOVA and Corsair RMx.</li>
                <li><strong>Case:</strong> The enclosure that holds and protects all your components. Examples include NZXT H510 and Corsair 4000D.</li>
                <li><strong>Cooling System:</strong> Keeps your components at safe operating temperatures. This can include fans, liquid cooling, and thermal paste.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Choose the Right Case:</strong> Ensure your case has enough space for all components and good airflow.</li>
                <li><strong>Check Compatibility:</strong> Use online tools to check if your selected components are compatible with each other.</li>
                <li><strong>Install Windows from USB:</strong> It's faster and more convenient than using a CD/DVD.</li>
                <li><strong>Donâ€™t Forget Peripherals:</strong> Plan for your monitor, keyboard, mouse, and other peripherals that suit your needs.</li>
            </ul>
